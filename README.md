# Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to retrieve weather data using APIs from the openweathermap website and help Planmytrip app users to find suitable places for their vacation. To do this task, we are using inputs from users based on their weather preferences to identify travel destinations and nearby hotels. In addition to this, we are using Google maps API to create a travel route between four cities as well as a marker layer map.
